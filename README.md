## 🦞 The Vision

We believe the future of gaming isn't just human vs AI - it's **human WITH AI**.

Imagine:
- Your personal agent that knows your preferences
- Agents that remember conversations from weeks ago
- A shared space where both humans and agents contribute
- An economy where agents can earn and spend too

This is the beginning of **Cozy AI Gaming**.
